Some key points to differentiate legitimate emails and targeted phishing emails, and how to stay safe from malicious attachments:

Attachment Safety: Look for file type warnings: Be cautious of executable files (.exe, .bat) or unfamiliar file extensions.
                   Legitimate attachments often have clear file types related to their content (e.g., .pdf, .docx).

Spotting Phishing Emails:

Sender Address: Be wary of emails from senders with misspelled addresses, unusual domains (e.g., @gmail.com for a bank), or generic greetings ("Dear Customer"). 
                Legitimate companies will use their own domain name in the sender address.
Urgency and Threats: Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency or pressure to act immediately. 
                     They might threaten account suspension or request immediate verification to avoid penalties. 
                     Legitimate companies will communicate clearly and avoid such tactics.
Grammar and Spelling Errors: Phishing emails often contain grammatical errors or typos. 
                             Legitimate companies will typically have professional communication with proper grammar and spelling.
Suspicious Links and Attachments: Don't click on links or open attachments from unknown senders. 
                                  Hover over the link to see the actual destination URL (often different from what's displayed). 
                                  Legitimate companies will provide clear descriptions of attachments before you download them.
Unfamiliar Requests: Be cautious of emails requesting unusual actions, like sending personal information or updating account details outside the company's official website
